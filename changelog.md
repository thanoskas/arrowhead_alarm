### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **ESX Support Removed**: ESX Elite-SX panels are no longer supported in this version. If you need ESX support, use version 1.x or the ESX-specific branch.

2. **Area Configuration**: Areas are now manually configured during setup (auto-detection unreliable). You must specify which areas are active.

3. **Entity IDs**: Area panel entities now have different naming scheme (e.g., `alarm_control_panel.arrowhead_eci_area_1`).

4. **Configuration Format**: Some configuration options have changed. Existing installations may need reconfiguration.

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### From Version 1.x to 2.0.0

1. **ESX Users**: Do not upgrade if you have ESX panels. Stay on v1.x or use ESX branch.

2. **ECi Users**:
   - Backup your configuration
   - Remove the old integration
   - Install v2.0.0
   - Reconfigure with manual area specification
   - Update automations to use new entity IDs

3. **Automation Updates**:
   - Update entity IDs for area panels
   - Review new services for better functionality
   - Update zone entity references if needed

### 🧪 Testing

- Tested on ECi F/W Ver. 10.3.51 (MODE 4 fully functional)
- Tested on ECi F/W Ver. 10.3.50 (MODE 4 supported)
- Tested with 1-3 areas configured
- Tested with up to 248 zones
- Tested with output expanders (up to 32 outputs)
