## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect to panel  
**Solutions**:

- Verify IP address and port number
- Check network connectivity to panel
- Ensure panel's TCP interface is enabled
- Try default credentials (admin/admin)

**Problem**: Authentication failed  
**Solutions**:

- Verify username/password combination
- Check User PIN format: `"[user] [pin]"`
- Ensure user has sufficient privileges
- Try different user accounts on panel

### Zone Detection Issues (ECi)

**Problem**: Zones not detected automatically  
**Solutions**:

- Disable auto-detection and set zones manually
- Check that zones are properly configured in panel
- Verify areas are active in panel configuration
- Use manual configuration override

**Problem**: Wrong number of zones detected  
**Solutions**:

- Override max zones in integration options
- Check panel configuration for actual zones
- Verify expander modules are properly configured

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow response or timeouts  
**Solutions**:

- Increase scan interval in integration options
- Check network latency to panel
- Verify panel isn't overloaded with connections
- Consider panel firmware updates

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.arrowhead_alarm: debug
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Zone Names

Zone names can be customized during setup or in integration options:

```yaml
# Example custom zone names
Zone 001: "Front Door"
Zone 002: "Kitchen Window"  
Zone 003: "Living Room Motion"
Zone 004: "Basement Door"
Zone 005: "Garage Motion"
```

### Multiple Panel Support

Each panel requires a separate integration instance:

1. Add first panel through normal setup
2. Add additional panels via "Add Integration"
3. Use different IP addresses for each panel
4. Entities will be named with panel-specific identifiers

### Home Assistant Brands

This integration is registered with Home Assistant Brands for consistent UI appearance. The panel icon and manufacturer information are automatically configured.

## Supported Panel Models

### ESX Elite-SX Series

- **ESX-1** (Not tested but should work)

### ECi Series

- **ECi - Pro**
