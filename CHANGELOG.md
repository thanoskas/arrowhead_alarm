## 🎉 What's New in Version 2.2.0

### Inproved event hadnling

✅ Better commands handilg (handle message sequences)
✅ Real-time updates (<200ms instead of 0-30 sec)
✅ No more "Failed to bypass" errors
✅ Instant zone state changes
✅ Responsive UI


## 🎉 What's New in Version 2.1.1

### 🚀 Full Individual Area Control

**Two-Tier System:**
- **Main Panel Entity**: Arms/disarms ALL areas simultaneously (MODE 4)
- **Area Entities**: Individual control per area (MODE 4 ARM, MODE 2 DISARM)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Individual Area Arming**: ARMAREA/STAYAREA commands (requires P74E/P76E configuration)
- ✅ **Individual Area Disarm**: Automatic MODE 2/4 switching for area-specific disarm
- ✅ **Smart Protocol**: Client handles mode switching automatically

**Panel Requirements:**
- `P74E` - Configure areas for individual away arming
- `P76E` - Configure areas for individual stay arming

> **Note**: Without P74E/P76E configuration, ARMAREA/STAYAREA will fail with ERR 2

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **ESX Support Removed**: ESX Elite-SX panels are no longer supported in this version. If you need ESX support, use version 1.x or the ESX-specific branch.

2. **Area Configuration**: Areas are now manually configured during setup (auto-detection unreliable). You must specify which areas are active.

3. **Entity IDs**: Area panel entities now have different naming scheme (e.g., `alarm_control_panel.arrowhead_eci_area_1`).

4. **Configuration Format**: Some configuration options have changed. Existing installations may need reconfiguration.

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### From Version 1.x to 2.0.0

1. **ESX Users**: Do not upgrade if you have ESX panels. Stay on v1.x or use ESX branch.

2. **ECi Users**:
   - Backup your configuration
   - Remove the old integration
   - Install v2.0.0
   - Reconfigure with manual area specification
   - Update automations to use new entity IDs

3. **Automation Updates**:
   - Update entity IDs for area panels
   - Review new services for better functionality
   - Update zone entity references if needed

### 🧪 Testing
