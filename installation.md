## Configuration Wizard

The integration includes a comprehensive configuration wizard that guides you through setup:

### Step 1: Panel Type Selection
Choose your alarm panel type:
- **ESX Elite-SX**: Traditional panels with up to 32 zones
- **ECi Series**: Advanced panels with up to 248 zones

### Step 2: Connection Configuration
Enter your panel's network information:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **IP Address** | Panel's IP address | `192.168.1.100` |
| **Port** | TCP port (usually 9000) | `9000` |
| **User PIN** | Format: "user pin" | `"1 123"` |
| **Username** | Admin username | `admin` |
| **Password** | Admin password | `admin` |

### Step 3: Zone Configuration (ECi Only)
For ECi panels, configure zone detection:

- **Auto-detect zones**: Recommended for most setups
- **Manual configuration**: Override detected settings
- **Zone naming**: Customize zone names (optional)

### Step 4: Output Configuration
Specify how many outputs to control:
- **ESX panels**: Usually 4-16 outputs
- **ECi panels**: Usually 4-32 outputs

## Post-Installation Setup

### Verify Installation

1. **Check Integration Status**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Devices & Services
   - Find "Arrowhead Alarm Panel"
   - Status should be "Connected"

2. **Check Entities**:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Devices & Services â†’ Arrowhead Alarm Panel
   - Verify all expected entities are created
   - Check entity states are updating

3. **Test Basic Functions**:
   - Try arming/disarming the system
   - Check zone sensors respond to physical zone activity
   - Test output controls (if safe to do so)

### Configure Zone Names

If you didn't customize zone names during setup:

1. Go to **Settings â†’ Devices & Services**
2. Find **"Arrowhead Alarm Panel"**
3. Click **"Configure"**
4. Enable **"Configure zone names"**
5. Set friendly names like "Front Door", "Kitchen Window", etc.

### Set Up Automations

Create basic automations for your security system:

```yaml
# Example: Arm system when leaving
automation:
  - alias: "Auto Arm Away"
    trigger:
      - platform: zone
        entity_id: device_tracker.phone
        zone: home
        event: leave
    action:
      - service: arrowhead_alarm.arm_away

# Example: Notification on alarm
  - alias: "Alarm Notification" 
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: alarm_control_panel.arrowhead_esx_elite_sx
        to: 'triggered'
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "ðŸš¨ Security Alert"

```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Common Issues

#### Integration Not Found

- Ensure user has sufficient privileges

#### Missing Entities
**Problem**: Expected entities not created

**Solutions**:
- Check integration logs for errors
- Verify panel configuration
- Try reconfiguring with different settings
- Enable debug logging for details

### Debug Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:

  logs:
    custom_components.arrowhead_alarm: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant and reproduce the issue. Check logs at **Settings â†’ System â†’ Logs**.
